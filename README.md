- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeterCyrus
- 👀 I’m interested in the Musa Alphabet.  Musa is a universal script with several interesting features; you can read all about it on musa.bet.  Our group of collaborators is  developing all the tools needed to use it, but we always need more software, fonts, translation, presentation and pedagogical material, forums, and much more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Musa tools.
- 📫 How to reach me: pcyrus@musa.bet.
